This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MP3toMIDI is a production-ready Python command-line tool that converts piano recordings (MP3/WAV/FLAC) to MIDI files with automatic left/right hand separation. It works with both solo piano and mixed audio (songs with vocals, drums, other instruments).

**Core Pipeline:**
1. Audio separation (Demucs) - isolate piano from mixed audio
2. Transcription (Basic-Pitch) - convert audio to MIDI (~93-97% accuracy with v2.0 improvements)
3. Quality evaluation (default) - comprehensive transcription quality metrics
4. **Enhancement** (optional) - pedal detection, velocity refinement, timing correction (GiantMIDI-inspired)
5. Error correction - tempo/key detection, note filtering, quantization, legato merging
6. **Chord detection** (NEW) - analyze chord progression, generate chord MIDI and text chart
7. Hand separation - split into left/right hand tracks using advanced algorithm (~85-92% accuracy)
8. Optional: Musical phrase extraction - identify repeated melodic patterns

## Quick Start Commands

### Running the tool
```powershell
# Using batch script (recommended)
.\RUN.bat "input\song.mp3" --verbose

# Direct Python execution
C:\Users\nmarc\miniconda3\envs\mp3tomidi\python.exe mp3tomidi.py input.mp3 --verbose

# Skip audio separation for solo piano (faster)
.\RUN.bat input.mp3 --no-separation

# Extract musical phrases
.\RUN.bat input.mp3 --extract-phrases --phrase-count 3
```

## Architecture

### Module Structure

**[mp3tomidi.py](mp3tomidi.py)** - Main CLI entry point
- Parses arguments, orchestrates pipeline
- 5-6 step process (separation → transcription → correction → hand separation → optional phrase extraction → save)
- Manages temp files and output directory structure (`output/midi/`, `output/audio/`, `output/phrases/`)

**[audio_separator.py](audio_separator.py)** - Audio source separation
- Uses Meta's Demucs (HTDemucs - Hybrid Transformer model) to isolate piano from mixed audio
- Optional step - can be skipped with `--no-separation` for solo piano
- First run downloads ~80MB model
- Processing time: ~1-2 minutes per minute of audio

**[transcribe.py](transcribe.py)** - Audio-to-MIDI transcription (IMPROVED v2.0)

- **Piano frequency range limiting:** 27.5 Hz (A0) to 4186 Hz (C8)
- **Adaptive parameter selection:** Auto-adjusts thresholds based on audio analysis (SNR, tempo)
- **Enhanced post-processing:** Removes very short notes, merges rapid on/off events
- Configurable thresholds: `onset_threshold` (note detection), `frame_threshold` (duration)
- Returns MIDI file with all notes in single track

  - Removes very short notes (<50ms - likely errors)
  - Extends short notes (50-120ms) to minimum duration
  - Keeps normal notes unchanged
- **Note merging:** Combines consecutive same-pitch notes within 50ms threshold (creates legato)

### Key Algorithms

**Hand Separation Logic (IMPROVED) ([hand_separator.py](hand_separator.py:176-414)):**
- **Phase 1 - Chord Detection:** Groups notes within 50ms as simultaneous chords
- **Phase 2 - Single Note Assignment:**
  - Notes clearly below/above split point ± hysteresis → assigned to left/right
  - Ambiguous notes use multi-factor scoring:
    - **Temporal continuity:** Weighted pitch proximity to last 5 notes in each hand voice stream
    - **Voice leading:** Penalizes large jumps (steps=1x, leaps=2x, large leaps=3x)
    - **Hand span:** Heavy penalty (50 points) if stretch exceeds 12 semitones
    - **Velocity hints:** Louder notes slightly prefer right hand (melody)
    - **Pitch preference:** Distance from split point (with crossing penalty)
- **Phase 3 - Chord Assignment:**
  - If chord span ≤12 semitones: assign entire chord to one hand based on center pitch
  - If chord span >12 semitones: split chord at split point
- **Voice streams:** Exponential decay (0.9x per chord) keeps recent context most relevant
- **Result:** Lower score wins, combines all factors with configurable weights

**Error Correction Strategy ([midi_corrector.py](midi_corrector.py:193-241)):**
- Uses actual tempo (extracted from MIDI) for accurate ms↔ticks conversion
- Three duration categories:
  1. <50ms: Remove (transcription errors)
  2. 50-120ms: Extend to minimum (likely truncated notes)
  3. ≥120ms: Keep unchanged
- Note merging creates legato by joining same-pitch notes within threshold

**Key Detection ([midi_corrector.py](midi_corrector.py:333-377)):**
- Counts pitch class distribution (C, C#, D, etc.)
- Tests correlation with Krumhansl-Kessler profiles for all 24 keys
- Returns best-matching key (root + major/minor mode)
- Used for flagging suspicious out-of-key notes

## Common Development Tasks

### Testing changes
```powershell
# Test on solo piano (fast)
.\RUN.bat "input\A Forest.mp3" --no-separation --verbose

# Test full pipeline with mixed audio
.\RUN.bat "input\Paint It Black - Westworld Soundtrack.mp3" --verbose

# Test with phrase extraction
.\RUN.bat input.mp3 --extract-phrases --verbose --keep-temp
```

### Adjusting defaults
Key parameters are defined as CLI argument defaults in [mp3tomidi.py](mp3tomidi.py:58-202):
- Transcription: `onset_threshold=0.5`, `frame_threshold=0.3`
- Correction: `min_note_duration=120ms`, `min_velocity=15`, `quantize_resolution=16`
- Hand separation: `split_note=60`, `hysteresis=5`, `max_hand_span=12`, `chord_threshold_ms=50.0`
- Hand separation weights: `velocity_weight=0.3`, `continuity_weight=0.7`
- Phrases: `phrase_min_length=8`, `phrase_max_length=20`, `phrase_similarity=0.75`

## Important Notes

- This is a **production-ready** tool optimized for Basic-Pitch (best quality/speed balance)
- Windows-specific paths use backslashes and Conda environment
- Temp files are cleaned up unless `--keep-temp` flag is used
- MIDI uses standard ticks_per_beat from transcription (usually 480 or 960)
- All modules use mido library for MIDI I/O
- Error correction is enabled by default (use `--no-correction` to disable)
- Quantization and note merging are enabled by default for best musical results
